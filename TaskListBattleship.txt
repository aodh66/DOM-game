Make a game:

# Battleship
## Basic version
Singleplayer, computer places ships, you are guessing which tiles have enemy ships, and attempting to beat your lowest number of guesses to hit all ships.
- render a grid
- Randomly place ships for the player to try and hit
- Have rules so ships are lines and a set size
  - Only let ships go in vertical or horizontal lines?
- have the tiles be clickable
- detect if a ship is below on click
  - then render ship
- Track number of clicks for score
- Create a fail state screen
- Button to reset and play again


Lloyds thoughts 

- Need a way to hide ships when not the players turn ie. looking at the other players board.
- score counts - seperate function
- graphics - could we use GIFs to make it look more polished? render a background GIF in the square rather than just a white or grey tile etc.
- how to make ships multiple squares?
- general styling....
- how to check when all ships hit and declare winner
